We have a 16x2 LCD for the UI.

When the UI is idle, we show a status display (one of several
choices).  That's the easy bit.  We enter menu mode as soon as any
button is pressed.

The UI is based on hierarchical menus.  The current menu name always
appears in the top row.  The UP and DOWN buttons are used to choose a
submenu, and ENTER is used to select it.  There is always a **back**
option that goes up a menu.

Eventually you reach a menu that has no submenus; you choose an option
instead.  The possible options appear as a menu, with the currently
chosen option having a "*" against it.  Pressing ENTER sets the "*"
against the current option; if the current option already has the "*"
then pressing ENTER goes up a menu.
